    "The upcoming **Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)** is expected to discover 100x more astronomical transients than current surveys. With limited resources for spectroscopic follow-up, it is crucial to identify interesting objects based purely on their **lightcurves** (change in brightness over time)."
